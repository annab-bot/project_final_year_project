    <li>HARDDISK
      Definition: Also known as a Hard Disk Drive (HDD), it is a data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital information.
      Purpose: It is used to store the operating system, software applications, and files. Hard disks are known for their large storage capacities and relatively low cost compared to Solid State Drives (SSDs).
      Characteristics:
      Storage Capacity: Ranges from hundreds of gigabytes (GB) to several terabytes (TB).
      Speed: Slower compared to SSDs due to mechanical parts.
      Appearance: Typically a rectangular box with a metal enclosure. It has connectors for power and data cables.</li>
   <li> RAM (Random Access Memory)
    Definition: RAM is a type of volatile memory that provides high-speed data access to the CPU and is used for storing data that is actively being used or processed.
    Purpose: It allows the computer to quickly access data needed for running applications and processes, improving the overall performance and speed.
    Characteristics:
    Volatility: Loses its data when the computer is powered off.
    Speed: Very fast compared to HDDs and SSDs.
    Appearance: Typically in the form of sticks or modules that are inserted into the motherboard. These modules are rectangular with several chips on them.</li>
<li>CABLES
  Definition: Cables are physical connectors that transmit data and power between various components of a computer system.
  Purpose: They are essential for connecting components like hard disks, motherboards, power supplies, and external devices.
  Types:
  Data Cables: Such as SATA cables (for connecting HDDs and SSDs), USB cables (for peripherals), and Ethernet cables (for network connections).
  Power Cables: Used to supply power to components from the power supply unit (PSU).
  Appearance: Can vary widely in form, including thin, flexible wires with connectors at each end.</li>

<li>CASES
  Definition: The computer case (or chassis) is the enclosure that houses all the internal components of a computer, such as the motherboard, power supply, storage devices, and cooling systems.
  Purpose: It provides physical protection for the components, facilitates airflow for cooling, and organizes the components for easier access and maintenance.
  Characteristics:
  Form Factor: Comes in different sizes and shapes, such as ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ITX.
  Material: Can be made from metal, plastic, or a combination of materials.
  Appearance: Usually a large rectangular box with openings for ventilation, ports, and drive bays.</li>
<li>Keyboard
  Definition: A keyboard is an input device that uses keys or buttons to allow the user to input text and commands into a computer.
  Purpose: It is the primary method of typing text and interacting with software applications. Keyboards can also include special keys for functions like media control, volume adjustment, and shortcuts.
  Characteristics:
  Layout: Typically includes alphanumeric keys, function keys, and control keys.
  Types: Can be wired or wireless, and may use different switch types like mechanical or membrane.
  Appearance: Usually a rectangular, flat device with keys arranged in a grid pattern.</li>
